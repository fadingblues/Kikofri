<p><strong>If I were asked to answer the following question: WHAT IS SLAVERY? and I should answer in one word, IT IS MURDER, my meaning would be understood at once.</strong></p>

<p>No extended argument would be required to show that the power to take from a man his thought, his will, his personality, is a power of life and death; and that to enslave a man is to kill him. Why, then, to this other question: WHAT IS PROPERTY! may I not likewise answer, IT IS THEFT, without the certainty of being misunderstood; the second proposition being no other than a transformation of the first?.</p>

<h2 id="property-is-theft---">PROPERTY IS THEFT! . . .</h2>
<p>What a revolution in human ideas! PROPRIETOR and THIEF have been at all times expressions as contradictory as the beings whom they designate are hostile; all languages have perpetuated this opposition.</p>

<h3 id="my-name-like-yours-is">My name, like yours, is‚Ä¶</h3>
<p>Of what consequence to you, reader, is my obscure individuality? I live, like you, in a century in which reason submits only to fact and to evidence. My name, like yours, is TRUTH- SEEKER.[1] My mission is written in these words of the law: SPEAK WITHOUT HATRED AND WITHOUT FEAR; TELL THAT WHICH THOU KNOWEST!<br />
¬µ¬µThe work of our race is to build the temple of science, and this science includes man and Nature. Now, truth reveals itself to all; to-day to Newton and Pascal, tomorrow to the herdsman in the valley and the journeyman in the shop. Each one contributes his stone to the edifice; and, his task accomplished, disappears. Eternity precedes us, eternity follows us: between two infinites, of what account is one poor mortal that the century should inquire about him?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[1] In Greek, {GREEK e ncg } examiner; a philosopher whose business is to seek the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="universal-error">Universal Error</h2>
<p>Disregard then, reader, my title and my character, and attend only to my arguments. It is in accordance with universal consent that I undertake to correct universal error; from the OPINION of the human race I appeal to its FAITH.</p>

<p>Others offer you the spectacle of genius wresting Nature‚Äôs secrets from her, and unfolding before you her sublime messages; you will find here only a series of experiments upon JUSTICE and RIGHT‚Ä¶ The operations shall be conducted under your very eyes; and you shall weigh the result.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I build no system. I ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An End To Privilege,</li>
  <li>The Abolition Of Slavery,</li>
  <li>Equality Of Rights,</li>
  <li>The Reign Of Law.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Justice,</li>
  <li>Nothing Else;</li>
  <li>That Is The Alpha And Omega Of My Argument</li>
</ol>

<p>A defender of equality, I shall speak without bitterness and without anger; with the independence becoming a philosopher, with the courage and firmness of a free man.</p>

<p>May I, in this momentous struggle, carry into all hearts the light with which I am filled; and show, by the success of my argument, that equality failed to conquer by the sword only that it might conquer by the pen!</p>

<p>But I must say that I recognized at once that we had never understood the meaning of these words, so common and yet so sacred: JUSTICE, EQUITY, LIBERTY.</p>

<p>That concerning each of these principles our ideas have been utterly obscure; and, in fact, that this ignorance was the sole cause, both of the poverty that devours us, and of all the calamities that have ever afflicted the human race.</p>
